First of all, SRMR stands for speech-to-reverberation modulation energy ratio. It is a objective quality metric developed for reverberant and dereverberated speech. The evaluation of the metric is performed against the so-called MOS (mean opinion square). The MOS is normally obtained by averaging a set of rates given by subjective normal-hearing listeners after evaluating a number of speech files. <br><br>

<b>Computation of SRMR</b> <br><br>

The first step comprises of filtering the input signal, <i>x</i>(n) with a 23-channel filterbank. <br><br>
