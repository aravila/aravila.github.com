Welcome to this blog! 

It is meant to be a follow up of the activities developed during the deep learning course (ift6266h16) undertaken at Universite de Montreal (UdeM).

In my research, I intend to use deep learning to develop feature representation of speaker identity for the purpose of buiding robust Speaker Verification System (AVS). These features may carry out acoustic information (i.e., noise and reverberation), which can be used to make our classifier environmental-aware. Moreover, we can mitigate AVS performance degradation by training our algorithm to interpret reverberant speech signal in a similar way humans do.
