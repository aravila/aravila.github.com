Project follow-up...


Finally, I was able to get some code running. I've been using Lasagne tutorial and the receipes available in its repository. Lasagne is a very handy library to build and train neural network with Theano. At this point, I am trying different configurations for my CNN in order to improve my results, which by now is bellow the expected baseline.
