        <b><u>Short Bio</u></b><br><br>

        I received my BSc degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos (UFSCar), and my MSc degree in Information Engineering from the Federal University of ABC (UFABC), both in Brazil, and my PhD from INRS. <br><br>

        My research background is on Signal Processing and Machine Learning (ML) applied to Natural Language and Speech Processing (NLP). During my PhD, I developed two new models for speech quality assessment and two methods to increase the robustness of voice biometrics. <br><br>

        Prior to joining INRS-UQO as an Assistant Professor, I was a Research Scientist in natural language and speech processing, working on projects related to model compression, low-latency and robustness of Machine Learning models. <br><br>


        <b><u>Early Career</u></b><br><br>

        In 2013, I was granted two scholarships that were very important for my researcher career: the <a href="https://www.educanada.ca/scholarships-bourses/can/institutions/elap-pfla.aspx?lang=eng" target="_blank">Emerging Leaders in the Americas Program (ELAP)</a> and the <a href="https://www.staracom.mcgill.ca/programs/Grants.html?var=EN" target="_blank"> STARaCom</a>. These scholarships allowed me to come to Canada for the first time as a short-term visiting researcher at INRS. Thus, I conducted part of my Master's at <a href="https://musaelab.ca/" target="_blank">MuSAE Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://inrs.ca/la-recherche/professeurs/tiago-h-falk/" target="_blank">Prof. Tiago H. Falk</a>, working on speaker and emotion recognition in unconstrained environments. <br><br>
