<i>The central challenge in machine learning is that we must perform well on new, previously unseen inputs </i> - Deep Learning book
<br><br>


<!-- Deep Learning Book - page 110 -->
The goal of training a machine learning algorithm is to minimize the training error. This can be seen as an optimization problem. Well after optmizing the algorithm on the training set, we want to verify if our model can perform well on unseen examples as low training error does not guarantee low generalization error.
