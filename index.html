        My main research lies on speech quality assessment, voice biometrics and speech emotion recognition. During my PhD, I proposed two new speech quality measures based on i-vectors. I have also worked on the robustness of speech-based technologies “in the wild,” being my main concern the performance of such technologies in real-world scenarios, where factors such as varying accent, emotions, vocal effort, background noise and reverberation can be detrimental. I am enthusiastic with the clever combination of machine learning and signal processing techniques towards speech applications. I am also very interested in natural language processing!
