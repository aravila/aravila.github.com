       I am an Associate Professor at INRS-EMT, working in the INRS-UQO Joint Research Unit in Cybersecurity. 
        My research interest is three fold. I work on strategies to minimize the transmission of sensitive data from edge devices to the cloud. The main goal is to decentralize deep learning AI
from the cloud by enabling efficient training and inference of AI algorithms on low-power devices.
Second research interest lies on the use of  successful pre-trained language models, such as BERT, GPT
and T5, combined with knowledge graph  to detect malicious intentions and prevent
semantic cyberattacks. The third research interest is focused on mitigating spoofing attacks, such
as replays and speech synthesis, on authentication systems.

Previously, I was a researcher scientist in natural language and speech processing at
Huawei Technologies Ltd., Noah’s Ark Lab. I am currently working on
projects related to model compression, low-latency and robustness of
spoken language understanding.

During my PhD, my research interests included two projects related to cybersecurity:
speaker veri cation in emotional settings and countermeasure
strategies to mitigate spoo ng attacks. I also have worked on psychoacoustics
