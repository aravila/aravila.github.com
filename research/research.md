      My research aims at developing methodologies, techniques and tools to foster cybersecurity
from the perspective of recent developments of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These are my main research interests: <br><br>

      <b><u>Federated Learning and Privacy</u></b><br>

      Researching advances and open problems in Federated Learning.<br><br>

      <b><u>Misinformation</u></b><br>
      Exploring human language technologies to combat Misinformation. <br><br>

      <b><u>Biometrics Robustness</u></b><br>
      Mitigating the use of deepfake signals towards biometric systems.

<!--      My research interest is three fold. First, I plan to investigate how to minimize the transmission of
      sensitive data from edge devices to the cloud. The main goal is to decentralize deep learning AI from the cloud by enabling efficient training and inference of AI algorithms on low-power devices. Second, I plan to investigate how successful pre-trained language models, such as BERT, GPT and T5, combined with knowledge graph can be used to detect malicious intentions and prevent semantic cyberattacks. The third research interest is focused on mitigating spoofing attacks, such as replays and speech synthesis, on authentication systems.

		A particular concern of my research is the dissemination of misleading information that culminate in confusion and risktaking behaviours. This is aggravated by the expansion of social media and internet use, which enable digital information to be spread more rapidly. In times of pandemic, for example, infodemic can have a detrimental impact on health behaviours during health emergencies. In times of election, on the other hand, disinformation campaigns can lead to election boycotts from national and international actors that intend to harm and/or promote specific candidates.<br><br>

      Another concern of this program is data privacy. In an era where AI has had great impact on science, businesses and on the public sector, data become the main feedstock of tools such as machine learning and data science. These models are often trained with a massive amount of centralized data available on a server. This exposes individuals to privacy risks and organizations to legal problems if data is not protected properly. In light of that, we propose to investigate a decentralized learning paradigm, named Federated Learning, where machine learning problems are solved on device, under the supervision of a central server or service provider.<br><br>

      Our last concern regards authentication which is also an important aspect of cybersecurity. In particular, we will investigate the robustness of voice biometrics towards a variety of voice spoofing attacks, which is characterized by imposters/fraudsters that use different strategies to fool the automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems to bypass the security of someoneâ€™s home or stealing money from a bank account, etc. -->
