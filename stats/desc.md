Descriptive statistics refers to a set of methods to summarize the data. It helps to understand and analyze the information conveyed in the data. The most important thing about these methods is that they allows us to analyze the data without actually having to analyze every single individual observation. It would be a hard task for a very large database. Let's say, for example, we want to present the grade of students in the university. Instead of listing all observations, by student, we could provide some summary statistics such as the average grade, or the percentage within each grade ("A", "B", "C", "D", etc), or the most frequent grade. These are examples of numerical summaries extracted from the data. Tables, graphs are yet other used descriptive statistics.
