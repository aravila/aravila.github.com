Inferential statistics refers to methods used to make predictions based on the observed data. Mostly, it helps to infer information about the population given a sample extracted by the same population. It is really important for the samples to be representative so that the inferences can be reliable (i.e. we are confident about our claims). For example, given a group of students with average grade B, can we infer that the whole population of students also has average grade B?
