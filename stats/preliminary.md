Statistics is essential for almost any research area. That's because it provides researchers with methods for understanding data and making sense of their results. Basically, data is a collection of numbers that describes something or some phenomenon. The scientist job is to make sense of these numbers and try to find relationships among them and, of course, translate it into words. Thank to statistics we do not need to analize the raw data directly 
(i.e. every single observation of our data). Image doing it for a very large dataset. Instead, we can apply statiscal methods do summarize our data. This is called <b>Descriptive Statistics</b> and is used to describe the data. Although, our dataset might be large it rarely represent the whole population which is our ultimate goal. For example, out data could contain information about a group of students which represent a sample from the population. Statistics will help us to make generalization about the population (maybe all the students in a university, or city) just by looking at the sample. This is called <b>inferential statistics</b>.

At this point, it is important to quickly brush up some important concepts. 

<br><br>
<b>Population</b> is the total number of subjects present in the study.
<br><br>
<b>Sample data</b> is simply a subset of the population from where data is collected.
<br><br>
<b>Parameter</b> is a numerical summary of the population.
<br><br>
<b>Statistic</b> is a numerical summary of the sample data.
